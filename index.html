					<h4>His Family and Early Years:</h4>
					    <ul><p><li>Billy Graham was the oldest of four children and grew up on a family dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina.

								   which was the reason he felt led to become a preacher.</li><br>
								<li>He was rejected by a local youth group because he was thought to be "too worldy".</li><br>
								<li>In May of 1936, Billy Graham graduated from Sharon High School.  He then attended Bob Jones College and was
								    nearly expelled. He thought the courses there were too legalistic.  He transferred to the Florida Bible Institute in 1937. </li><br>
								<li>In 1939, he was ordained.  In 1943, he graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois with an Anthropology degree.</li><br>

						</p></ul>
					<h4>Heart of his Mission:</h4>
				        <ul><p>
						<li>Billy Graham believed that the <strong>Bible</strong> was <strong>God's perfect words revealed to mankind</strong>.</li><br>
				        <li>More than 3.2 million people have responded to his invitation to accept Jesus
						    Christ as their personal savior, to turn from their sins, and to commit to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.</li><br>
						<li>Billy Graham told stories  many people could relate to.  He asked them to be honest and to meet Jesus "just as they are".  The
						    hymn "Just As I Am" was often sung or played at the invitations near meeting ends.</li><br>

						<li>He said, "Our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with Christ everyday".</li><br>
						<li>He trained church members to spread the gospel in small group settings, in their own homes.  This
                            effort was considered the <strong>largest outreach in Christian history</strong>.<br><br>
						<li>Billy Graham was respected by mainline Protestant and Catholic churches because he encouraged
						    the new converts to join in with their existing ministries.</li><br>
						<li>When asked whether evangelists should be involved with politics, he replied, "You know, I think
						    in a way, that has to be up to the individual, as he feels led of the Lord.  A lot of things that I commented
							on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some, like communism or
							segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out."</li></br>
						<li>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association states: "Life is sacred, and we must seek to protect all
						    human life: the unborn, the child, the adult, and the aged."</li>

						</p></ul>
                    <h4>Growing in His Ministry</h4>

					   <ul><p>
					    <li>He was an ordained Southern Baptist minister and founded the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA).</li><br>
						<li>He led more than 400 spiritual revivals ("Crusades") all over the world and <strong> preached the gospel
						    to more people than anyone in the history of Christianity.</strong></li><br>
						<li>Billy Graham became well-know all over the world beginning in the 1940s.
						    He spent <strong>six decades</strong> appearing on TV and radio broadcasts.</li><br>
						<li>When he was 29, he became the president of Northwestern Bible College in Minneapolis.  He was the youngest
						    president in the whole country and he kept the position for four years.</li><br>
						<li>He authored many books of which many became best-sellers. Just a few of the titles are: <strong>The Jesus
                            Generation</strong>, <strong>Angels:  God's Secret Agents</strong>, <strong>How to Be Born Again</strong>,
                            <strong>The Secret of Happiness</strong>, <strong>Peace With God</strong> and <strong>
                            Calling Youth to Christ</strong>.</li><br>

						<li>He received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, October 15, 1989.</li><br>
				        <li>Billy Graham was awarded many honors in his lifetime.  He was often included on "Top Ten:  Most Admired Man", "Greatest Living
						    American" and "Most Admired Person in the United States" lists.</li>
						</p></ul>
			        <h4>Friend to National Leaders:</h4>
					    <ul><p>
						<li>He provided spiritual guidance to all the presidents from Harry S. Truman(33rd)
						    to Barack Obama(44th).</li><br>
					    <li>He had a friendly relationship with Queen Elizabeth II and was invited by the Royal Family to special
							events.  He also preached at Winsor Chapel.</li></p></ul>

			        <h4>Segregation, Human Rights and Controversial Topics:</h4>
					    <ul><p>
						<li>He denounced segregation and warned white audiences: "We have been proud and thought we were better than
						any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride."</li><br>

						<li>He told a Ku Klux Klan member "There is no scriptural basis for segration.  The ground at the foot of
						the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at
						the cross."</li><br>
						<li>Billy Graham was clearly against communism and he was clearly for the Vietnam War.</li><br>
						<li>He went to the Soviet Union in 1982 and preached. While there, he also attended a World War II memorial.(The Soviets
						    and Americans were allies against Nazism.)</li><br>
						<li>During the Cold War, he was the first evangelist to speak behind the Iron Curtain. (Eastern Europe and the
						Soviet Union).</li><br>
						<li>During the Apartheid era, Graham refused to go to visit South Africa until its government
						allowed integrated seating for everyone.</li><br>
						<li>In 1970, Billy Graham voiced his opinion on feminism as "an echo of our overall philosophy of permissiveness" and
						    at the time felt women would be happiest in their role as homemaker, wife and mother.</li><br>
						<li>In 1974, he referred to homosexuality as a sin, "a sinister form of perversion."</li><br>

						<li>He opposed same-sex marriage and was labeled as "homophobic" by some writers.</li><br>
						<li>Billy Graham opposed most abortions except in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.</li><br>
						<li>He was a registered Democrat. He didn't want to be too affiliated with the religious right, and said
						    that Jesus did not have political party.</li><br>
						<li>He said, "Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person.  We have to stand in
						    the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. <strong> I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the
							past.  I will be in the future</strong>."</li><br>
						<li>In 1997 (at age 79), Billy Graham had been criticized for his "watered down" version of Christianity, and he was even
						    considered the Antichrist by some. He was trying to include the entire world when he said,
							"I think that everybody that loves or knows Christ, whether they are conscious of it or not,
							they are members of the body of Christ...[God] is calling people out of the world for his name, whether they come from the Muslim world,
							or the Buddhist world or the non-believing world, they are members of the Body of Christ because they have been called by God.
							They may not know the name of Jesus but they know in their hearts that they need something they do not have, and they turn to the only
							light they have, and I think that they are saved and they are going to be with us in heaven."</li>
